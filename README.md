# Object Detection and Tracking with YOLOv8 and StrongSORT: Drone-Captured Data

This repository showcases my graduate thesis project focused on leveraging YOLOv8 for real-time object detection and integrating StrongSORT for accurate object tracking. By harnessing drone-captured data, this project explores the synergy between advanced computer vision algorithms and aerial imagery, opening up new possibilities for surveillance, mapping, and more.
